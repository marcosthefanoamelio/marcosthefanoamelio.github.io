	      <h3>Research Interests</h3>
	      <p> My main interest lies within Geometric Group Theory. More concretely, the goal of my PhD project was to constuct <b> non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of odd characteristic </b> (see the preprint for the result). In the process of the construction, I became interested in <b> geometric small cancellation </b> and thus also in <b> groups acting on Gromov-hyperbolic spaces </b>. Lately, I have also developed an interest on the <b> Boone-Higman conjecture </b> and in the (closely related) <b> twisted Brin-Thompson groups </b>. </p>
