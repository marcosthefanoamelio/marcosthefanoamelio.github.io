	<h2>Marco Amelio</h2>
I am currently a postdoc within the at the Institute for Algebra and Geometry at the Karlsruhe Insitut für Technologie (KIT), in the working groups of Dr Elia Fioravanti and Jun Prof Dr Claudio Llosa Isenrich. Previously, I did my PhD at the Logic Institute within the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Universität Münster, in the workgroup of Prof Dr Dr Katrin Tent.

	      <h3>Research Interests</h3>
	      <p> My main interest lies within Geometric Group Theory. The goal of my PhD project was to constuct <b> non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of odd characteristic </b>. In the process of the construction, I became interested in <b> geometric small cancellation </b> and thus also in <b> groups acting on Gromov-hyperbolic spaces </b>. Lately, I have also developed an interest on the <b> Boone-Higman conjecture </b> and in the (closely related) <b> twisted Brin-Thompson groups </b>. </p>
